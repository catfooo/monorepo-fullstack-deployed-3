// asyncHandler: We use asyncHandler to simplify error handling in asynchronous code. It helps us avoid writing repetitive try-catch blocks by automatically catching errors and passing them to our error handling middleware. This makes our code cleaner and more readable, reducing the risk of unhandled exceptions that could crash the server.

// Create an instance of the Express router
// The router method in this code is like setting up a map or a blueprint for handling different kinds of requests in a web application. It helps organize and define how the application should respond when someone visits different URLs. Think of it as creating a list of instructions for the app to follow when it receives specific requests, like "show me all tasks" or "register a new user." This makes the code neat and helps the app know what to do when someone interacts with it.

// Define a route for handling GET requests to retrieve all tasks
// router.get("/get", async (req, res) => {
//   // Use the TaskModel to find all tasks in the database
//   // Mongoose Method: TaskModel.find()
//   // Description: This route handles HTTP GET requests and uses the TaskModel to find all tasks in the database. The find() method is a Mongoose method that retrieves all documents from the specified collection (in this case, the "tasks" collection). The found tasks are then responded to the client in JSON format.
//   await TaskModel.find()
//     .then((result) => res.json(result)) // Respond with the found tasks in JSON format
//     .catch((err) => res.json(err)); // Handle any errors that occur during the operation

    // Description: This route handles HTTP PUT requests and is responsible for updating a specific task by its ID. It extracts the task ID from the request parameters, and then it uses the findByIdAndUpdate() method, which is a Mongoose method, to find and update a task by its ID. In this case, it marks the task as done by setting the done property to true. The updated task is then responded to the client in JSON format.

    // Description: This route handles HTTP DELETE requests and is responsible for deleting a specific task by its ID. It extracts the task ID from the request parameters and then uses the findByIdAndDelete() method, which is a Mongoose method, to find and delete the task by its ID. If the task is found and successfully deleted, it responds with a success message and the deleted task in JSON format. If the task is not found, it responds with a 404 error.
    await TaskModel.findByIdAndDelete(id)
      .then((result) => {
        if (result) {

router.post(

  asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
    // Extract the task data from the request body
    const task = req.body.task;
    // Use TaskModel to create a new task with the provided data
    // Mongoose Method: TaskModel.create({ task: task })
    // Description: This route handles HTTP POST requests and is used to add a new task to the database. It extracts the task data from the request body and then uses the create() method, which is a Mongoose method, to create a new task document with the provided data. The newly created task is then responded to the client in JSON format.
    await TaskModel.create({
      task: task,
    })
      .then((result) => res.json(result)) // Respond with the newly created task in JSON format

// Export the router for use in the main application
export default router;

// In summary, this Express application sets up API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks using a Mongoose model (TaskModel) to interact with a MongoDB database. The Mongoose methods used in each route are tailored to perform specific database operations (e.g., find, update, delete, create) based on the route's purpose. The code also handles errors that may occur during these database operations and responds to client requests with appropriate JSON data.
