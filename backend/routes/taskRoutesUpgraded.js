//In this code, we have defined a set of routes for a Node.js Express application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The routes handle requests to retrieve all tasks, update a specific task, delete all tasks, delete a specific task by ID, and add a new task. These operations are performed using the TaskModel from the Task model file. The code responds with JSON data for each operation and handles any errors that may occur during the database operations. Overall, this code sets up the API endpoints for managing tasks in the application.
